### How do I set up? ###


#### Step 1: Get the lib project into the 'projects' folder ####
The following code will checkout the lib project into the correct folder
and link it to npm so that it can be used as a standard node module. In the terminal, run the following commands:

    cd projects
    git clone git@bitbucket.org:hspconsortium/sandbox-manager-lib.git
    cd sandbox-manager-lib
    npm link
    cd ../../
    npm link sandbox-manager-lib

#### Step 2: Build and Deploy ####

You can build and deploy Locally or on Docker

###### For Local Deployment
    ./run-local.sh

###### For Docker Deployment ####

    ./run-local-docker.sh

The set up process is complete and your project is running now.  The service is available at:
* http://localhost:3001/

#### Configuration ####

Various property files configure the sandbox manager:

 * package.json

#### System Dependencies ####
